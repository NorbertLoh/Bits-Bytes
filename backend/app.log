2025-08-30 13:54:55,172 - INFO - Feature: Curfew login blocker with ASL and GH for Utah minors, To comply with the Utah Social Media Regulation Act, we are implementing a curfew-based login restriction for users under 18. The system uses ASL to detect minor accounts and routes enforcement through GH to apply only within Utah boundaries. The feature activates during restricted night hours and logs activity using EchoTrace for auditability. This allows parental control to be enacted without user-facing alerts, operating in ShadowMode during initial rollout., Answer: {
  "feature_type": "Legal Requirement",
  "compliance_status": "Compliance Logic Needed",
  "supporting_regulations": [
    "Utah Code 13-63-102 (Age requirements for minors on social media platforms)",
    "Utah Code 13-63-103 (Prohibition on data collection for minors)",
    "Utah Code 13-63-104 (Parental consent and account restrictions)"
  ],
  "reasoning": "The feature involves age verification, data collection, and parental consent mechanisms for Utah minors, which are explicitly regulated under Utah’s Social Media Regulation Act. Compliance requires adherence to state-specific laws (e.g., COPPA, Utah Consumer Privacy Act) and potential cross-border data transfer considerations if third-party services (e.g., EchoTrace, GH) operate in jurisdictions with stricter privacy standards. The feature’s geo-specific targeting of Utah minors necessitates alignment with local legal frameworks, but additional review is needed to confirm third-party compliance and jurisdictional boundaries."
